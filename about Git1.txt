## What is git?
  Git is a widely used control system around the world. 
  Git monitors the changes we make to the files, so it keeps a record of 
  what has been done and allows the user to revert to certain versions 
  if he needs it. It facilitates collaboration and synchronization by 
  allowing the changes made by multiple people to be merged in a single point, 
  field (source).

## Awesome software
  Being a locally running software, Git has the feature of keeping history. 
  It allows easy collaboration with other developers as it has a central location
   where we can upload changes made to the code and download changes from others.
  The best feature of git is that it automatically merges changes so that two people 
  can work on different parts of the same file, and then merge these changes without 
  losing each other's work.

## Which users benefit from Git?
  Git is useful for anyone who writes code and wants to keep track of changes 
  to files. Especially Web developers, application developers take advantage 
  of git's features.
